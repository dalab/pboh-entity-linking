Paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02301 (proc. WWW 2016)

Code: coming soon ...

News: 

results on the newest version 1.2.1 of Gerbil can be found here: http://gerbil.aksw.org/gerbil/experiment?id=201602110004 . The InKB results are the ones of interest (since we do not address the issue of out of KB entities). Please note that there is a drop in performance of all systems from version 1.1.4 to version 1.2.1 of Gerbil (details here: https://github.com/AKSW/gerbil/issues/98)
